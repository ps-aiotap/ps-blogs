My experience (short)

Over the last two years I’ve led delivery of multiple AI-driven platforms that use the pattern above — an AI compliance automation platform, a transaction intelligence platform, a friction analytics service, and a predictive analytics pilot. Each focused on building production-grade reliability, auditability, and operational workflows.

The 2026 imperative

Fintech organizations that adopt AI thoughtfully — with engineering rigor, security, and governance — will gain a durable competitive edge. This demands engineering leaders who can translate model outputs into operational workflows and compliant systems.

Closing (networking CTA)

I’ll share more practical posts on architectures, testing/CI for AI systems, and scaling teams to build these platforms. If you’re an engineering leader or product owner working on AI in fintech, I’d love to hear how you’re approaching these challenges.
